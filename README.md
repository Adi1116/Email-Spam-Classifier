# Email-Spam-Classifier

Email spam classification is a common application of machine learning, where the goal is to automatically distinguish between legitimate emails (ham) and unsolicited, often malicious emails (spam). One popular approach for this task is using a supervised learning algorithm, such as a Naive Bayes classifier or a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Let's take an example of a Naive Bayes classifier for email spam classification:

Data preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the email data. This typically involves removing any irrelevant information like email headers and converting the email text into a suitable format for analysis. The preprocessing steps may also include tokenization (splitting the email text into individual words or tokens), removing stop words (common words that do not carry much meaning), and applying stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their root form.

Feature extraction: In order to train a machine learning model, we need to convert the email data into numerical features that the algorithm can understand. Commonly used features include word frequencies, bag-of-words representations, or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors. These features capture the presence and importance of specific words or phrases in the email.

Training the model: Once the email data has been preprocessed and transformed into numerical features, the next step is to train the machine learning model. In the case of a Naive Bayes classifier, the algorithm assumes that the presence of each feature is independent of the presence of other features. It calculates the probability of an email being spam or ham based on the occurrence of different words or phrases in the training data.

Model evaluation: After training the model, it needs to be evaluated to assess its performance. This is typically done using a separate set of labeled emails that were not used during the training phase. Common evaluation metrics for email spam classification include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model's performance can help identify areas for improvement or fine-tuning.

Prediction and deployment: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the spam or ham label for new, unseen emails. The trained model can be deployed in a production environment where it automatically analyzes incoming emails and classifies them as spam or ham.
